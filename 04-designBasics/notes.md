# Section 4: The Basics of Design

## Designing for Clarity

- Make data easy to interpret
- Build CREDIBLE visualization
- Keep the focus on the data

### Edward Tufte's design principles

- Graphical Integrity
  - don't contrue the data
  - e.g. start bar charts at 0
- The Lie factor
  - a value to describe the relation between the size of effect shown in a graphic and the size of effect shown in the data
  - eg don't skew the viz so that data you want to emphasize looks bigger
- Chart junk
  - elements that distract from the data without providing information
  - eg - anything 3D, background images/lines
- Data-to-ink Ratio
  - measure the amount of chart junk
  - the less junk, the higher data to ink ratio

## Subjectivity in Design

### What makes a great visualization?

- Grabs users attention
- Encourage further exploration
- Build new and interesting type of viz

### Is Chart Junk always bad?

- No

## The Design Toolkit

- tricky for the brain to tell the difference of the area of two objects, slope, angles
- brain likes quantitative data
- some visual channels are better at expressing data than others
- Different channels are better for different types of data

### Types of data:

- Quantitative (numerical)
  - e.g. 1,2,3,.1, .43, 10%, 3/4, etc
- Categorical (categories)
  - e.g. African, Asian, male, female, etc
- Ordinal (rankings)
  - e.g. big, small, tall, short, etc

### Color Selection

- dont use more than 5-8 colors for categories
- Dont use a devergin color scale for quantitative data
- Consider color-blind users

## An Intro to Sketching

- think how site should look before coding
- think through the different options of how to communicate your data
- communicate your abstract ideas to clients and colleagues (how is it received)

### Rules

- write sketches on paper - should be disposable/iterable
- make the sketches big to accomodate change
- Know what the point of the chart is an convey that through the grid

### Bootstrap Grid

- use to easily make charts reponsive
